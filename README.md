# Master-Mind
A WPF application were the user can try to beat the computer on a game of Master Mind.

Master Mind is a classic board game, read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

Back in 2016 I created an WPF version of this game, the focus in the application was not on the design. At this point in time I focused more on learning the XML layout of WPF.
